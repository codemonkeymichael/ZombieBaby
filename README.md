### Script   
   
**Sleeping:**    
Snoring  
Heaving Breathing  
Crying Sobbing   
Having a Nightmare Garbled:   
"Mother I promise I'll be good"     
"Teddy where did you go?"   
"Daddy don't leave me here"   
"The baby is going home"   
"It's so dark in here, please let me out"   
  
**Awake:**   
Growling angry   
Humming happy   
Clears throat  
Yawning  
"Why did you wake me I need my beauty sleep"  
"I'm grumpy when I wake up, you don't want to see me grumpy"     
     
**Sitting Up:**   
Screams
Laughing   
"I'm hungryâ€¦ For human flesh"    
"What are you looking at, is there something in my teeth?"    
"This place is so boring"     
"Who gave you that face, I look more like my father"
