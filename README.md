### Script   
   
**Sleeping:**    
Snoring  
Heaving Breathing  
Crying Sobbing   
Having a Nightmare Garbled:   
"Mother I promise I'll be good"     
"Teddy! Teddy, where did you go?"   
"Daddy don't leave me here"   
"The baby is going home"    
"It's so dark in here, please let me out"    
"Mommy I'm scared"   
  
**Awake:**   
Growling angry   
Humming happy   
Clears throat    
Yawning    
"Why did you wake me I need my beauty sleep"    
"I'm grumpy when I wake up, you don't want to see me grumpy"   
"I'm hungry, Feed me, Feed me brains... NOW!!!"   
"Can't you read the sign!"   
"Ahhhhh! Whats wrong with your face."   
"Whoa! Take a step back, your scaring me."    
     
**Sitting Up:**   
Screams  
Laughing   
"I'm hungryâ€¦ For human flesh"    
"What are you looking at, is there something in my teeth?"     
"This place is so boring"      
"Who gave you that face, I look more like my father"      
"Are you real? No way."   
"I had a nightmare it was election day."    
"Can I just have a little taste? RRRrrrrgg"   
"Someone call 911, dude needs some help."     
"I only like brains when its fresh. You can go."    
"Don't worry, I don't have Covid, I invented it."   
"Hey you should talk to the manager, I think you could be one of the exhibits."   
"Hey come over here, real close now, come on, (sniff, sniff) never mind."   
"Don't worry about it, it's just a little scratch."   
"Hey, I think we look a lot a like, don't you?"   
"My older sister and I didn't get along, so I ate her liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. Tisk Tisk Tisk"  
"Who are these freaks in my room!"
